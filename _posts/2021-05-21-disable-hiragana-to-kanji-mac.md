title: Disable Hiragana to Kanji Conversion on Mac
published: true
---

Macs offer a convenient solution for seamlessly switching between English and Hiragana alphabets. I regularly switch between the two when working on my Japanese language homework. In an effort to "assist" with the document composition MacOS will automatically convert the Hiragana to Kanji when applicable. As a novice Japanese language student, this is counterproductive because I don't yet recognize many Kanji.

Fortunately this auto-conversion can be easily disabled. Open your system preferences and navigate to the Keyboard settings. Click on the `Input Sources` tab and uncheck the `Live Conversion` option.
