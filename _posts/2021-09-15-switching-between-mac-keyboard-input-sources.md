title: Switching Between Mac Keyboard Input Sources

The Japanese language uses three alphabets (Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji), and it's typical for a standard sentence to involve all three. For instance the sentence <i>Which car is Jason's car?</i> would look like this:

ジェイソンさんの車どの車ですか。

Therefore when writing Japanese on the Mac you'll need to efficiently switch between the alphabets.
