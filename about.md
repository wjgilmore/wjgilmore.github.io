Jason Gilmore is a Dublin, Ohio-based technologist who spends his days working at <a href="https://xenon.io" rel="nofollow">Xenon Partners</a>. Prior to stepping into his current role, Jason served as CEO at the online coding school <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, and prior to that as CTO of <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com/" rel="nofollow">DreamFactory Software</a>. He has spent much of the past 20 years helping companies of all sizes build amazing products (see <a href="/portfolio.html">portfolio</a>).

Jason is the author of nine books, including the bestselling "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-PHP-MySQL-Novice-Professional/dp/1430231149/" rel="nofollow">Beginning PHP and MySQL, Fourth Edition</a>", "<a href="https://leanpub.com/easylaravel" rel="nofollow">Easy Laravel 5</a>", "Easy PHP Websites with the Zend Framework, Second Edition", and "Easy Active Record for Rails Developers" (see [publications](/books.html)).

Over the years Jason has published more than 300 articles within popular publications such as Developer.com, JSMag, and Linux Magazine, and instructed hundreds of students in the United States and Europe.

Jason is (since retired) cofounder of the wildly popular <a href="https://www.codemash.org/" rel="nofollow">CodeMash Conference</a>, the largest multi-day developer event in the Midwest. Away from the keyboard, youâ€™ll often find Jason playing with his children, hunched over a chess board, or having fun with DIY electronics.

Jason is creator of <a href="https://emailreputationapi.com">EmailReputationAPI</a>. He launched EmailReputationAPI in response to the rampant abuse he's witnessed over the years with regards to bots, scammers, and credit card fraudsters signing up to legitimate online services using anonymized and illegitimate personal email accounts. EmailReputationAPI offers an easy API which will help companies identify both personal and anonymized email domains whether at time of registration or during periodic CRM audits. It's still a side project for now, but provides something fun to hack on as well as offers a useful service to the larger Internet business community.
